# CS663_Retinal-Blood-Vessels-Segmentation
## Overview
This project focuses on the segmentation of retinal blood vessels using classical edge detection filters and advanced neural network architectures. The goal is to accurately classify pixels as either part of blood vessels or background in retinal images.

### Features
Used different kind of filters to generate the features:
1. Sobel Edge Detection Filter
2. Gaussian Kernel
3. Gaussian Blur
4. Prewitt
5. Laplacian
6. LOG (Laplacian of Gaussian)

### Cascading Neural Network
Implemented a Cascading Neural Network to classify pixels based on the features extracted from the classical edge detection filters.

### RedNET-20 Architecture
Utilized the RedNET-20 architecture for pixel classification. This architecture is designed to enhance the accuracy of pixel-wise segmentation tasks.
